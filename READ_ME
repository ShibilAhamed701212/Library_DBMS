🗄️ Database Design

    Tables:

        - users   → user accounts and roles
        - books   → library inventory
        - issues  → issue/return history (transactional)


    Key Design Decisions:

        - Issue records are never deleted
        - Returning a book updates return_date

        This allows:
            - Full audit trail
            - Analytics
            - Reports

        Active issues are identified using:

            WHERE return_date IS NULL


⚙️ Setup Instructions

    1️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate        # Linux / Mac
        .venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows


    2️⃣ Install Dependencies

        pip install -r requirements.txt


    3️⃣ Configure Environment

        Create .env file:

            DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
            DB_PORT=3306
            DB_NAME=library_db
            DB_USER=app_user
            DB_PASSWORD=App@123
            FLASK_SECRET_KEY=super-secret-library-key


    4️⃣ Setup Database

        Run the SQL schema:

            source database/schema.sql;


    5️⃣ Seed Initial Data

        python database/seed_data.py


▶️ Running the Applications

    🌐 Run Flask Web App

        python run.py

        Open:
            http://127.0.0.1:5000


    🖥️ Run CLI Application

        python mainCLI.py


📊 Dashboard Metrics Explained

    Metric          Meaning
    ------          -------
    Total Users     Number of registered users
    Total Books     Number of books in catalog
    Active Issues   Books currently issued (not returned)

    Returned books are not removed from DB —
    only marked with return_date.


🧪 Technologies Used

    - Python 3.10+
    - Flask
    - MySQL
    - mysql-connector-python
    - bcrypt
    - Pandas
    - openpyxl
    - Jinja2
    - HTML / CSS


🏆 Best Practices Followed

    - Separation of concerns
    - No SQL in routes
    - Centralized configuration
    - Reusable services for Flask & CLI
    - Transaction-safe DB operations
    - Production-ready architecture
    - Python-based seeding (no raw inserts)


📌 Notes for Evaluation / Viva

    - Demonstrates real-world DBMS concepts
    - Shows transaction handling
    - Uses analytics beyond CRUD
    - CLI and Web share same business logic

    Clear distinction between:
        - Active vs Historical data
        - Read vs Write responsibilities
